# Simple Factory Design Pattern

# Factory Method Design Pattern

## Intent
- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Defining a "virtual" constructor.
- The new operator considered harmful.

# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Intent
- Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms", and the construction of a suite of "products".
- The new operator considered harmful.
