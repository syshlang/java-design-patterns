# Prototype Design Pattern

# Prototype Design Pattern

## Intent
- Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
- Co-opt one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future instances.
- The new operator considered harmful.

## Discussion
Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual "clone" method, and, maintains a dictionary of all "cloneable" concrete derived classes. Any class that needs a "polymorphic constructor" capability: derives itself from the abstract base class, registers its prototypical instance, and implements the clone() operation.

The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the "new" operator on a hard-wired class name, calls a "clone" operation on the abstract base class, supplying a string or enumerated data type that designates the particular concrete derived class desired.
